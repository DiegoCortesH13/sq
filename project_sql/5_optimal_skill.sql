Question:

What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts and Data Scientists based on demand from companies and salary expectations?
- Identify skills high in demand and associated with high salaries for Data Analysts and Data Scientists. 
  We are going to separate the analysis for both roles.
- Focus on roles with specified salaries, and positions located in Mexico City, Mexico or remote roles.
 - Why? It is important to identify which skills offer the most job security (high demand) and offer the best economic 
   return (high salary) for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, helping job seekers prioritize their learning and career development.
