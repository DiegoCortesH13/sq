ðŸ”¹ Airflow, BigQuery, and PyTorch indicate that high-paying data scientist roles favor:

    Cloud data engineering tools (Airflow, BigQuery)

    ML/deep learning libraries (PyTorch)

    Programming skills in systems languages (Go)

    BI and visualization tools (Looker)


ðŸ”‘ Common Themes Across Both Roles:

    Modern cloud/data platforms (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks) dominate.

    Pipeline and orchestration tools (Airflow, Spark, Hadoop) are key to higher pay.

    Knowledge of scalable systems and NoSQL databases boosts salaries.

    Cross-functional skills in both analytics and engineering yield better compensation.
